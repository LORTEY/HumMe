Android app for guess this song party game. It utilizes spotify api for adding tracks to guess from playlists, albums and artists links. It also downloads song lyrics using genius api, allowing for easier recall of the song.

Have fun.

App is currently in beta tests and will stay in this state for quite a while untill I get an idea of what I want this app to look like or find critical errors in it.

In the future I will try to change spotify api manager from spotipy to native kotlin api manager to enable user to add private playlists. Update gradle broke because of it but I will still try. Was able to fetch refresh token from spotify callback. Private Playlist supporting version will be available soon.
